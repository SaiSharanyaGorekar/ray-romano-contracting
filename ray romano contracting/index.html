<h1>JAMIE FLOYD: <i>UPPER WEST SIDE CLASSIC 6</i> </h1><br>
<p>
    "Ray Romano rocks. Listen to this: He did a complete GUT on an eight-room wreck in less than 8 weeks. I do not recommend it for anyone. It is CRAZY. But <br>
     we have little kids and we had no choice. Ray Romano and his team got it done! The place is beautiful!"
</p> <br>
<h1>DONNA AND SCOTT: <i> RESCUED RENOVATION</i></h1> <br>
<p>"Ray rescued us from a contractor job gone bad. He and his crew are great, neat and real artisans. We recommend him very highly and I bet before we know <br>
     it, there will be another "Everybody loves Raymond," but on HGTV or TLC!"

</p><br>
<h1>DAVID SIEGEL:  <i>DOUBLED THE VALUE</i></h1><br>
<p>"Ray added value in ways that other G.C.s can't. Working with him is a pleasure. He more than doubled the value of my apartment through his gut <br>
     renovations. I would recommend him to any person looking to make home improvements."
